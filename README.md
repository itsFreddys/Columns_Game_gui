# Columns_Game_gui
Gui interpretation of a Columns game

Columns is a game reminiscent of Tetris, sharing the concept of falling pieces that, once settled, become immovable and are inspected for matching colors with neighboring blocks. The core mechanics mirror Tetris, granting players control over descending pieces that can be maneuvered horizontally using left and right arrows. Once a piece makes contact with the floor, player control is removed from set piece.

However, a distinctive feature of Columns is the inability of rotating falling blocks. Unlike Tetris, players cannot twist or flip the descending shapes; instead, they can rotate the internal colors of the block. This unique ‘twist’ adds a layer of strategy as players aim to align colors for potential matching.

The game concludes when a column of blocks reaches the top of the game grid, signaling a capacity limit that prevents further stacking. Thus, terminating the game.
